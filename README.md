# Day-Planner-Moment-JS-Adam-Cleland

Our fifth portfolio project for the Ohio State Bootcamp; In this project we are tasked with incorporating moment.js into our program to do many of the core features. Along with getting more familiar with going through Doc files in order to learn to use a more wide variety of tools.

## In this Program

    1. The user is greeted with the current date and time that is updated every second.
    2. The time blocks are color coated to reflect Past, Current, and Future times.
    3. The users input is saved to localData so refreshing the page will not wipe it.
    4. the user is able to add a list item by hovering over the li and clicking on the plus icon.
    5. the user is able to remove a list item by hovering over it and clicking on the X icon.
